# IBM Data Science capstone project

This is the final course in a series of 10 courses in order to earn the IBM Data Science certification. The series can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/programs/seb-learning-program-4irnx?authProvider=collegial&currentTab=MY_COURSES&productId=child~d5Ym7WWaEeuOYw4Q6REzlw&productType=s12n&showMiniModal=true).

The goal of the course was to use everything that was learned during the previous courses and use it to analyze SpaceX data. One acts as a data scientist for a new space startup which needs to be competitive with SpaceX. The way to do this was to analyze the data to find out which factors determine whether the mission had a successful outcome or not.

The summary of the course can be found in the *Presentation.pdf* file.
